## Simple TODO app written in Python
 
 clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/vmmax123/todo_prettytable.git
```



## Usage 

The focus of this project was to create a simple todo app that stored information, utilized the prettytable library, and challenged me to create something beyond simple scripts. 

Functions:
- 'A' adds a new task item
- 'C' marks items as complete
- 'D' deletes item
- 'X' to quit and reset the list

- stores tasks as a .pkl 

## Notes
Future additions:

- I would like to make a GUI for this app, which takes mouse input
- I would like to convert to FLASK

help from @BekBrace, and his great tutorial on how to start this app. I added a reset function, and saving the table to prettytable instead of using print statements for the table.
